# Introduction

Hi, 

This repo consists of my practice of R data visualizations during my PhD at Universite Grenoble Alpes.
Most probably I will post my code chunks in R markdown and R files here which will I use to write my thesis and research paper. 
Remember that I belong to the field of civil engineering so anyone who has that background can benefit from the terms used in the code.
